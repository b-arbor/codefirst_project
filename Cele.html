                        <p> The celebration of Easter in Czech Republic and Slovakia is rather unusual. On Easter Monday
                            boys have to braid willow branches together and decorate them with
                            colourful ribbons to then use them to whip girls while singing an Easter themed
                            song. The whipping should bring luck and fertility to the household. As an act
                            of gratitude the woman have to give painted eggs and sweets or alcohol to them.
                            In Slovakia and certain parts of Czech Republic the boys instead of whipping,
                            pour a bucket of cold water on the girls.

                        <p>The tradition of St. Nicholas day can be found in most of Eastern Europe with
                            certain specificity to different regions. St Nicholas walks from house to house
                            and asks children whether they have been good in the past year. The children are
                            supposed to sing a song or recite a poem. In Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland
                            and Ukraine St Nicholas is accompanied by Angel, representing the Good and gives
                            out sweets to good children and by Devil, representing the Evil. If the kid acts
                            bratty the Devil often puts the kid in a sack, threatening to take she or he to
                            hell or hands out a bag full of coal instead of sweets.

                    <p>Maslenitsa is traditional folk celebration in almost all Slavic countries.
                        However, the time and some details different from country to country. The main
                        ritual of this tradition is the burning of straw figure that represents the
                        Winter, which is accompanied by huge folk festivals . In Russia this celebration
                        is also known as pancake week, as the celebrations are full of eating
                        traditional Russian pancakes called blini, filled with various fillings
                        including caviar and sour cream. In Czech Republic and Slovakia is this
                        tradition followed by the celebration of day of Love, nowadays mainly celebrated
                        by kissing under the blooming tree, which should make the couples love stronger.
